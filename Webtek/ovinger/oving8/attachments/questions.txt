1. When calling getContext('2d') on a Canvas element, it will return a drawing context
(i.e. the type of canvas) - in this case a two-dimensional context. How can we get a threedimensional context instead?
-  you have to call either getContext('"webgl') og getContext('"webgl2'), but the contexts are only available on browsers that support the corresponding version

2. How would you create a blue circle using the Canvas element? Explain with words or code.
you can use an inbuildt function called arc, which the the paremeters:

but first, start with
context(the context of the canvas).beginPath()

then 
context. arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)

x and y is the center of the arc, and radius says itself....
the angles are messured in radians, not degrees so a full sircle is from 0 to 2pi
the last argument doesnt bother us because where going to draw the whole circle, but its automaticly set to false (clockwise)

to make the circle blue it its the command
context.fillstyle = 'blue'

and at last 
context.fill()

here is a pracical example:{
    context.beginPath()
    context.arc(250,250,50,0,Math.PI*2,true)
    context.fillStyle = 'blue'
    context.fill()
}


3. What is a more terse (also known as shorter) way of writing the loop in the following using
the Array.filter method?

yes, this for example:{
      const countries = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'New Zealand'];
      const countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter(country => country.startsWith('N'))
}
