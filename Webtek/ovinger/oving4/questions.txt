1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
  If your are using your mobile data, it wouldn't be as desierable to use up that, and you are on your phone everywhere and some plases, you dont want a video to start making noice.

2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?
  nothing happens, because your width is 320px, whitch is not between 768px to 1024px

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of
dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
  Its easier tho manage one site than two, and its less repeating code, and if you want to add a style if you are on a desktop(wide screen) its easier to add different style on new "types" of screen

  @media only screen
  and (min-device-width : 768px)
  and (max-device-width : 1024px) {
    #logo {
      display: none;
    }
  }
